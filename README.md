This repository includes data processing, analysis, and visualisation scripts used to investigate the structural behaviour of the MX3D Bridge, with a particular focus on temperature-driven load redistribution and modal behaviour.

This repository contains the codes used to support the analysis presented in the thesis. The scripts cover data processing and visualisation related to the structural performance of the MX3D Bridge under varying thermal conditions. Key areas of focus include:
Load Cell Analysis: Time-series processing and visualisation of hourly load data.
Temperature Correlation: Linear regression between mean temperature and recorded structural response to identify thermal effects.
Modal Analysis: Extraction and interpretation of natural frequencies using the Random Decrement Technique (RDT).
Strain Gauge Processing: Filtering and analysis of strain data to assess local structural behaviour.
Each script is modular, documented, and designed to enable reproducibility of the results presented in the thesis.
